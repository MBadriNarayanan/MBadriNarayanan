### A little bit more about me:
:one: I am currently pursuing my Masters in **Computer Sciences** at the [University of Wisconsin - Madison](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/). <br>
:two: At UW-Madison, I worked with Dr. Ran Zhang to implement <b>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)</b> and <b>fine-tune LLMs</b> on a custom dataset of radiology reports for enhanced diagnostic insight.<br>
:three: My most recent work experience was at Nokia Bell Labs as an Autonomous System Research Intern during Summer 2024 where I worked with LLMs in the context of automation and collaborative agents. <br>
:four: Before this, I worked as an Associate Engineer - AI/ML at Qualcomm, Hyderabad as part of the AISW team, where I worked on running inference for SOTA ML models and 
improving the in-house testing pipeline. <br>
:five: I completed my bachelor's **Information Technology** at [Sri Sivasubramnaiya Nadar (SSN) College of Engineering](https://www.ssn.edu.in), Chennai. <br>
:six: My [Sign Language Translation using Multi Context Transformer](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-89820-5_25) paper won the **3rd best paper award** at the 20th Mexican International Conference on Artificial Intelligence (MICAI), Mexico City, 2021.<br>
:seven: I have published two other papers titled [End-to-End Speech Recognition of Tamil Language](http://www.techscience.com/iasc/v32n2/45592) and [Fake News Detection using a Deep Learning Transformer Based Encoder-Decoder architecture](https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-intelligent-and-fuzzy-systems/ifs223980) which have been published in a Science Citation Index Expanded Journal.<br>
:eight: My primary interests lie in the fields of Machine Learning (ML), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs), Computer Vision (CV), and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). I want to work in the aforementioned fields and develop real-world solutions.<br>
:nine: Check out my [portfolio website](https://mbadrinarayanan.com) for more details and up-to-date Resume
